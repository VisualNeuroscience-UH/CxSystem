    Data structure saving the spikes and taking care of delays.
    
    Parameters
    ----------

    synapses : list of ndarray 
        A list of synapses (synapses[i]=array of synapse indices for neuron i).
    delays : ndarray
        An array of delays (delays[k]=delay of synapse k).
    dt : `Quantity`
        The timestep of the source group
    max_delay : `Quantity`, optional
        The maximum delay (in second) of synaptic events. At run time, the
        structure is resized to the maximum delay in `delays`, and thus
        the `max_delay` should only be specified if delays can change
        during the simulation (in which case offsets should not be
        precomputed).
    precompute_offsets : bool, optional
        A flag to precompute offsets. Defaults to ``True``, i.e. offsets (an
        internal array derived from `delays`, used to insert events in the data
        structure, see below) are precomputed for all neurons when the object
        is prepared with the `compress` method. This usually results in a speed
        up but takes memory, which is why it can be disabled.

    Notes
    -----

    **Data structure** 
    
    A spike queue is implemented as a 2D array `X` that is circular in the time
    direction (rows) and dynamic in the events direction (columns). The
    row index corresponding to the current timestep is `currentime`.
    Each element contains the target synapse index.    
    
    **Offsets**
    
    Offsets are used to solve the problem of inserting multiple synaptic events
    with the same delay. This is difficult to vectorise. If there are n synaptic
    events with the same delay, these events are given an offset between 0 and
    n-1, corresponding to their relative position in the data structure.
    They can be either precalculated (faster), or determined at run time
    (saves memory). Note that if they are determined at run time, then it is
    possible to also vectorise over presynaptic spikes.
