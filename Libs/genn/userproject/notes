in order to change between INDIVIDUALID and INDIVIDUALG connections, one needs to consider:

change the definition in the model definition (modelDefinition.cc)
change/ add a global conductance to be set for INDIVIDUALID
provide the right type of connectivity array, i.e., in the current hackky version load a float* from disk (INDIVIDUALG) or read a unsigned int* from disk (INDIVIDUALID) within map_classol (!).
