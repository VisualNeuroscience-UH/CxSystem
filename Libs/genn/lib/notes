in order to change between INDIVIDUALID and INDIVIDUALG connections, one needs to consider:

change the definition in the model definition (modelDefinition.cc)
change/ add a global conductance to be set for INDIVIDUALID
provide the right type of connectivity array, i.e., in the current hackky version load a float* from disk (INDIVIDUALG) or read a unsigned int* from disk (INDIVIDUALID) within map_classol (!).

notes on delay implementation (24-10-2014)
- circular spike queues are defined for spike events (not true spikes)
- there is a fixed number of delay slots (in time steps)


for future Brian interface:
- allow time delay queue granularity to differ from single time steps
- could write preprocessing software to analyse delay distributions and define delayslots and time granularity of the delay slots automatically

Questions:
- do we have one consistent mechanism for choosing a fixed device or doing autodevice detection?

- what are the differential roles of a predefine "Epre" parameter and the explicit model.nSpkEvntThreshold[*] values? 

GeNN synapse model scheme:
- two model parts (that can be combined arbitrarily):
1 postSynModel
  postSyntoCurrent: Code to convert synaptic state variables (could also be just constants) into an input current to be added to a differential equation for V

  postSynDecay: Code that is applied every time step to the summed input variable to a neuron (?)

extern "C" addition in front of neuron kernels to force clear text function names in the compiled cubin file. Note that this is disabling C++ fatures, so no overloading or templating ... not necessary at the moment but may be in the future.
