# this is a test
# [G] is for defining the neuron group:
# [G]   number_of_neurons    neurons_type   neuron_category   layer_idx
# some notes:
# neuron_type can be either PC,SS,etc.
# neuront_category can be either multicompartmental,soma_only,etc.
# layer_idx can be either array(compartmental neurons) or int (soma only neurons)
# you can also overwrite the default threshold, reset, refractory by adding the following at the end:
# [threshold]='vm>Vcut' and same structure for reset and refractory
####################
# [S] is for synaptic object:
# [S]   receptor_type   reference_group_index     target_group_index    synapse_type(STDP,etc)
# some description:
# - reference_group_index and target_group_index based on the index of the group in this configureation file
# - in case target_group_index is a compartment of the group you can use: target_group_index[C]target_compartment_number
#        target_compartment_number

[G] 10 PC multicomp [4,1]
[G] 15 PC multicomp [2,1]
